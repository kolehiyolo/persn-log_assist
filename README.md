# Kolehiyolo | Personal | Log Assist
Welcome! I am a hobby-coder and this is my "Log Assist" project, an NPM package that can be used as a better alternative than the traditional console-logging available w/ JavaScript. I find needing better logging especially for tracking errors, events, and for checking delays in server-related tasks.
